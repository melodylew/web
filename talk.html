    <h2> Painting as a Hobby </h2>
      <p> Painting is a great hobby to pick up on, especially if you are looking for something fun to do and something with health benefits. Not only does painting have mental health benefits, but physical benefits too. Painting helps reinforce memory and decreases the chances of getting a memory loss disease in the future. Painting prompts the artist to use critical thinking skills, which improves one's problem-solving and motor skills. In addition to these physical advantages, painting has mental health benefits. If you are under a lot of stress, or suffer from anxiety, painting is an amazing outlet to release your emotions and allow you to relax. And by releasing these emotions and putting them into art, it can possibly help you heal and evaluate the source of your stress. However, that does not mean you can paint only if you're in a bad mood. You can channel your happiness and positive energy into art as well! Painting piques a positive outlook on someone's life, whether it is by making them a happier person, or allowing them to see the art of life. Not to mention, one's creativity grows in the painting world! Everyone is creative in their own way, and painting can be a way for you to put your creativity on a canvas. The art world has no rules, and its openness welcomes everyone and accepts all their work as art. There's no excuse to not pick up a paintbrush!

    <h2> Painting Supplies </h2>
      <p> For a beginner, it's best to start out with acrylic paint. One of the pros of using acrylic paint is that it is water-soluble, so if you happen to make a mistake, you can wash it off. Acrylic paints are also versatile, so you can use it on different surfaces. For colors of paint, it depends on what types of paintings you do. If you happen to do more landscape paintings, then I suggest more earth tones such as browns, tans, deep reds, greens, and blues. However, if you do not have a particular style, I recommend purchasing the colors of the rainbow, or shades of your favorite color. With that being said, you can't put your paint to use without paintbrushes! Synthetic brushes are preferred since they are more durable and maintain their shape well. Definitely get different sized brushes and ones with different tips. This will allow you to experiment with different lines and give that extra oomph in your art. You should also purchase canvases or paper for you to put your art on. It's also helpful to have a palette for putting your paint on and mixing paints. <a href="https://www.michaels.com/">Michaels</a> is a great and affordable craftstore to buy these supplies from! </p>

    <h2> Painting Techniques </h2>
      <p> There are many painting techniques to use for your painting. The first one is wet brush on dry canvas, the most common one. It's self-explanatory, you wet your brush, dip it in paint, and apply it on your canvas. Alternatively, you can use a dry brush instead. Another technique is splatters, in which you dip your brush in paint and use your thumb to flick its bristles, creating splatters on the canvas. (You should protect your surface beforehand). You can also make gradients, or ombres, by painting streaks of color on your canvas, and before it dries, blend the colors. Another way to spice up your painting is not using a brush at all! Simply pour copious amounts of paint onto your canvas and then tilt the canvas to allow the paint to move around. Since I do a lot of sunset paintings, one of my go-to techniques is scumbling. Scumbling is when you first apply a layer of paint (for the background), then once it dries, you dip your brush in another color and paint the canvas. I typically use this for clouds. There's plenty more techniques to explore <a href="https://arteza.com/blog/36-acrylic-painting-techniques">here.</a> </p>

    <h2> Painting Inspiration </h2>
      <p> If you are ever stuck on what to paint, my suggestion is to experiment with different lines, shapes, and colors. It does not necessarily have to be "pretty," or resemble something. This is a great way to practice techniques and get the creative juices flowing. Another suggestion is to look at your surroundings and paint a certain object. Put your own twist on it by making it abstract, or playing with its proportions. Or, you can try a new type of painting. For example, if you normally do landscape painting, try still-life painting. You can also look at other famous artworks and put your own spin on it. Make it modern! Make it bigger! There's so many options for you to choose from if you are having painter's block!
